# R-Project
Repository for my R Data Analysis Project as a part of the NYC Data Science Academy


In this Data Science Project, I explore Periodic Transaction Reports (PTR's) filed by all congress members from 2014-2022.

After cleaning the data I ended up with ~16k transactions of every single buy or sell the congress members completed over the past 9 years. 

The goal of the analysis was to figure out if Congress as a whole was better at timing the stock market than the S&P500 as well as which congress members stand out as axcellent stock traders. 

In addition to cleaning and analyzing the data, I also created a Shiny App app to provide an easy to use dashboard to summarize individual congress members stock market activity as well as explore individual trades made by the congress person in question.

My Shiny App: **[Congress Stock Trading App](https://ay4dff-brian-schmidt.shinyapps.io/r-project/)**

I have created this app so that the user can summarize the data from these reports per representative and identify congress members who have a history of successful stock investments.
